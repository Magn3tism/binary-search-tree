# Binary Search Tree

An implementation of a binary search tree in JavaScript.

## Methods:
* `insert(value)` - inserts a new node with the given value into the tree
* `remove(value)` - removes the node holding the given value from the tree
* `find(value)` - returns the node holding the given value in the tree
* `levelOrder()` - traverses the level order
* `inorder()` - traverses the tree inorder
* `preorder()` - traverses tree preorder
* `postorder()` - traverses postorder
* `height()` - returns the height of tree
* `isBalanced()` - returns true/false based on whether or not the tree is balanced
* `rebalance()` - rebalances the tree
* `viewTree` - prints the tree in reader friendly format

Also included is a small script that tests most of the tree's functionality.
